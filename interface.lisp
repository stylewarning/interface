;;;; There's still some work to do, namely optimizing the
;;;; calls. There's also work in producing better error
;;;; messages. Lambda list congruence would be a start. Showing all
;;;; unimplemented functions in an error message would also be nice.
;;;;
;;;; I am also not convinced that the DEFINE-IMPLEMENTATION syntax is
;;;; as good as it can be.
